## Wechat Adapter Configuration ##

### Basic Config ###
* The hubot needs a real WeChatID
* The hubot's WeChatID should be include in the group to be listened on for auto-reply
* The group/specific person should be save into that contact list

### config.yaml ###
* A config.yaml is provided to set the configuration items 
  - Those items most are for wechat login in Hubot-WeChat startup

* Get config items method
  - Login the wechat from browser, use the wechatId which is used for hubot
  - **Capture data from webwxinit api from browser debug mode**

* url
  - baseUrl -- wx/wx2
  - Wechat server has traffic distribution to WX/WX2 server dependent on hubot's WeChat ID 

* Below data are needed and set into config.yaml apporiated fields 
  - header
    + cookie
  - BaseRequest
    + Uin
    + Sid
    + Skey
    + DeviceId

* maintainerName
  - Please fill the maintainer's wechat name (the maintainer should be in hubot's wechat contact list) 
  - Hubot will report its online status to maintainer in a configured interval

* webWxSyncInterval
  - To sync receiving message from WX server
  - Default: 1500 ms 

* syncCheckInterval
  - It is the heartbeat to WX server 
  - To trick WX server the login persion still on the web wechat
  - Default: 30s, it is same behavior in web wechat

* listenOnAllGroups
  - default value: true. Then hubot will listen on all the group where it is in

* listenGroupNameList
  - It is used to control hubot only listen on some group for auto reply 

* Other config item: it's simple to know from its meaning and you can check the code for its usage

## Design & Implementation Notes ##
* The problem
  - Scanning the QR code to login web wechat
  - No published official WeChat api interface
* Workaround for login
  - Need login manually by scanning the QR code once
  - Capture all the required data as hubot configuration(details in next slide) 
* Shoot the trouble
  - Use chrome/firefox to analyze web WeChat API
  - Try its web APIs by curl
  - Analyze the parameters and what it is
  - Analyze the wxApp.js
* Notes:
  - **The hubot wechat on the mobile side keeps online is preferred**
  - Reason: WeChat server disconnects your hubot with websync failure after 3~4 days. 
    But hubot works again once login mobile wechat app again.
